<h2 align="center" id="requirements"> Requirements </h2>

<p  align="center"> :warning: The project must be written in accordance with the <a href="https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf" target="_blank">Norm</a> </p>
The Norm  is a programming standard that defines a set of rules to follow when writing code at 42. It applies to all C projects within the Common Core by default, and
to any project where it's specified. These are some of them:

    Each function must be maximum 25 lines, not counting the function's own curly brackets.
    
    Each line must be at most 80 columns wide, comments included.
    
    A function can take 4 named parameters maximum.
    
    You can't declare more than 5 variables per function.
    
    You're not allowed to use: for , do...while , switch , case ,  goto  ,
    ternary operators such as `?' and VLAs - Variable Length Arrays.
  The norminette (as we call the norm at 42) is in python and open source.
  
  Its repository is available at https://github.com/42School/norminette.

42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms,
students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning),
with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills.
Not to mention that it's completely free of charge and open to all with no prerequisites.

Admissions at 42 are unlike other colleges. We use a merit-based admission process.
The final step of the admission is the Piscine - This is part of the admissions process and 
requires 4 weeks of intensive and immersive coding. No prior coding experience is necessary at all.
	
You can check more about the admission process on the 42sp website: https://www.42sp.org.br or on my github repository: <a href="https://github.com/augustobecker/42sp_Piscine">42 Piscine</a>
